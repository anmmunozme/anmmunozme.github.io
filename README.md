Keywords: Rent places, University of Illinois, Climate Chicago

The idea is to help a new student find a safe and affordable place to rent near Department of Computer Science - University of Illinois, Chicago.

This application allows us to find information about rental places in Chicago.

In this application I use the following Datasets:

from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web by Climate Data Online
- Global Summary of the Month Dataset
- Daily Summaries

from https://data.cityofchicago.org :
- Police Station Dataset
- Parks Dataset
- Fire Station Dataset
- Hospital Dataset
- Affordable Rental Places
- Crimes
- Bike Routes Dataset
(All those datasets can be located in the map)

Additionally I made a chart with c3.js and d3.js using the dataset "Global Summary of the Month Dataset".
